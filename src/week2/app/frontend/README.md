# Stuff ToDo For our Todo App

What else could we do here:

- Make it so we can toggle an item back to incomplete (Challenge: Low.)
- Make it so that when they add a Todo, it also allows them, optionally, to add a due date and a priority. (Challenge: Medium)

  - In our list, display the due date and the priority.

- Make it so that our list can be:

  - Filtered - have a set of buttons (think "set count by") that says "Show All" | "Show Completed" | "Show Incomplete"

    - When they click the button, the list is filtered.
    - Do not make any API calls for this.

  - Search - put a textbox above the list that when they type in it, it filters the list to items with whatever is in
    the textbox only. Challenge: Medium +
